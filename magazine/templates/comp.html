<h1 class="header">COMP THE HARVARD ADVOCATE</h1>
<p class="text">
Every semester, The Advocate selects new members through a “Comp” process open to all Harvard undergraduates. <br><br>
Between its seven boards--Art, Business, Design, Features, Fiction, Poetry, Technology--The Advocate provides a home for writers, artists, critics, designers, web designers, dealmakers, and all others with an interest in the arts and letters. <br><br>
Compers are evaluated exclusively on their ability to discuss, write about, create, design, sell, or code art. <br><br>
This semester, introductory comp meetings will take place on Thursday, January 29 and Monday, February 2 at 8pm at 21 South Street. <br><br>
Though our comp is selective, our hope is that all participants will find it an enriching and rewarding experience. <br><br>
